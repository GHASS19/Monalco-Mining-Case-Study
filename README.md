# Monalco-Mining-Case-Study

Monalco Mining is one of the world’s largest iron ore mining companies in the world and
has offices located across the globe. Its exploration efforts have revealed significant
iron resources in the Bass-Shingle Basin in Western Australia. Demand for iron has been
increasing around the world and market prices have ramped up significantly to $110
per ton of iron ore. To accommodate market demand, Monalco, along with many other
mining organizations, has invested heavily in operating technologies such as
ore-crushers and has poured money into maintenance to maximize production of iron
ore. However, with the increased market supply, which is rapidly overtaking demand,
prices have now shifted downwards, averaging $55/ton. In response to worsening
market conditions, the management team at Monalco has decided to focus on
streamlining costs, particularly maintenance expenditure, to limit the impact this has on
the business’ profitability.
